# 100 days of ml code
100 days of machine learning code as proposed by [siraj ravel](https://github.com/llSourcell)
# Day 1|Data Prepocessing
The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%202.ipynb)


data prepocessing is importing the data ,data integration,data cleaning,Encoding categorical data and splitting the data into training and test data
data preprocessing is the part where more time of machine learning is spent
# Day 2|Linear Regression
The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%201.ipynb)


Linear Regression is a method to predict dependent variable(Y) based on independent variables(X)
The equation of straight line y=mx+c

In this  [code](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%202.ipynb) we create a model that takes features of the house and from it predicts the price of the house
# Day 3|Linear Regression

The code is  [here](


Congratulations! You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!
