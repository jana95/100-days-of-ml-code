# 100 days of ml code
100 days of machine learning code as proposed by [siraj ravel](https://github.com/llSourcell)
# Day 1|Data Prepocessing
The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%201.ipynb)


data prepocessing is importing the data ,data integration,data cleaning,Encoding categorical data and splitting the data into training and test data
data preprocessing is the part where more time of machine learning is spent
