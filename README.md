# 100 days of ml code
100 days of machine learning code as proposed by [siraj ravel](https://github.com/llSourcell)
# Day 1|Data Prepocessing
The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%201.ipynb)


data prepocessing is importing the data ,data integration,data cleaning,Encoding categorical data and splitting the data into training and test data
data preprocessing is the part where more time of machine learning is spent
# Day 2|Linear Regression
The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%202.ipynb)


Linear Regression is a method to predict dependent variable(Y) based on independent variables(X)
The equation of straight line y=mx+c

In this  [code](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%202.ipynb) we create a model that takes features of the house and from it predicts the price of the house
# Day 3|Linear Regression

The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%203.ipynb)


Congratulations! You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!
# Day 4|Logistic Regression
The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%204.ipynb)


Logistic regression is to solve classification problems.the output of the model will be a binary value.
Logistic regression gives a discrete output

# Day 5|Logistic Regression

Watched a edureka video of regression(linear and logistic regression) and Los function calculation and how it is minimized

# Day 6|Logistic Regression

The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%205.ipynb)

Implementation of logistic regression

# Day 7|K Nearest Neighbours

knn is non parametric and instance based algorithm ,it is used for supervised learning.data is classified as the label of most of nearest data points,distance can be calculated by using Eucledian distance

# Day 8|Knn implementation

The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%208.ipynb)

knn is very helpfull when we need to classify a dataset without knowing the features or attributes of data.when we no idea about the data knn helps to classify them

# Day 9|Math behind logistic Regression

This article gave a clear insight on logistic regression.it gives a detailed explanation and math behind logistic regression  [(https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-detailed-overview-46c4da4303bc]  by Saishruthi Swaminathan

# Day 10|Support Vector Machines

Got a intution on svm ,watch siraj ravel's video on svm(math of intelligence)

# Day 11|Implemting svm

The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%2011.ipynb)

# Day 12| Book

first two chapters of Hands on machine learning with scikit learn and tensorflow

# Day 13|SVM 

implemented svm for iris dataset

The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%2013.ipynb)

# Day 14|Naive bayes Classifier

went through naive bayes classifier

# Day 15|Naive bayes implementation

The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%2015.ipynb)

Different tyes of naive bayes and implemented gaussian Naive bayes

# Day 16| SVM using kernel trick

Implementation of support vector machines using kernel trick

The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%2016.ipynb)

# Day 17|Deep learning specialization

! st week of neural networks and deep learning

# Day 18|Deep learning specialization

2nd week of neural networks and deep learning and implemented a logisic regression  neural network

# Day 19|Decision Trees

decision tree videos on edureka

# Day 20| Decision Tree implementation

The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%2020.ipynb)

# Day 21| Random Forest

Since decision trees get overfitted we use random forests,random forests contains many decision trees

# Day 22| Random Forest implementation

The code is  [here](https://github.com/jana95/100-days-of-ml-code/blob/master/Code/day%2022.ipynb)

# Day 23| Black box machine learning

Started bloomerang machine learning series ,first lecture black box machine learning on youtube

# Day 24| Bloomerang

Second lecture on bloomerang about a test case

# Day 25 | The Learning Problem

Started Lecture 1 of 18 of Caltech's Machine Learning Course - CS 156 by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa. It was basically an introduction to the upcoming lectures. He also explained Perceptron Algorithm.
